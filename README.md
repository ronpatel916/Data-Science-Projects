Hello! My name is Ronak Patel. This is my WIP portfolio of projects that I have been working on dating back to 2018.

I am currently a Solutions Consultant at Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters), primarily focusing on our desktop APIs and feeds for Investors and Traders. Throughout my role, I build proof of concepts to sell our data through programmatic delivery, such as APIs.

I am a graduate of the University of Michigan with a BSE in Chemical Engineering and a Master of Management Degree from the Michigan Ross School of Business. Throughout my masters program, I took several data science and business analytics, including:

  - TO 414 - Advanced Analytics For Management Consulting - a course utilizing R and Machine Learning models to learn descriptive analytics, predicitive analytics and prescriptive     analytics. (https://michiganross.umich.edu/courses/advanced-analytics-management-consulting-10363)
  - TO 412 - Big Data: Tools for Data Management and Acquisition - A capstone course where we utilized SQL to store, manage, and query databases via SQL, Tableau to quickly      
    construct insightful visualizations of multi-attribute data, and Python to manage data as well as connect to APIs to efficiently acquire public data.

  - TO 411 - Support with Excel - https://michiganross.umich.edu/courses/support-excel-9842
  
  I also competed in the Michigan Ross Datathon 2019, an MBA data analytics competition where we developed a data based solution built around county level data of water usage, water pollution, industrial and demographic concentration and quality of life. My team was proud to come in 1st place in this competition! Our final submission is provided in this repository.
  
  
In my free time, I am currently enrolled in dataquest.io Data Scientist in Python course as well as the Data Engineer course. Throughout the course, I have completed several projects that I have posted on this repo.
