    "# Building a Mobile App to Fight Lottery Addiction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people start playing the lottery for fun, but for some this activity turns into a habit which eventually escalates into addiction. Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",
    "\n",
    "A medical institute that aims to prevent and treat gambling addictions wants to build a dedicated mobile app to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning. We are going to help this institute to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first version of the app, we are going to focus on the 6/49 national lottery game in Canada to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Premise of the 6/49 Lottery Game\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, 6 numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers ranging from 1 to 49. The drawing is done without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 6/49 lottery, six numbers are drawn from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. A player wins the big prize if the six numbers on their tickets match all the six numbers drawn. If a player has a ticket with the numbers {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}, he only wins the big prize if the numbers drawn are {13, 22, 24, 27, 42, 44}. If only one number differs, he doesn't win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this project, we will need to calculate repeatedly probabilities and combinations. As a consequence, we will start by writing 2 functions to calculate factorials and calculate combinations."

    "- Combining the one_ticket_probability() and check_historical_occurrence() to output information on probability and historical occurrence at the same time\n",
