    "# Building A Spam Filter With Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to build a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "To classify messages as spam, a computer does several things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Learns how humans classify messages.\n",
    "2. Uses that human knowledge to estimate probabilities for new messages — probabilities for spam and non-spam.\n",
    "3. Classifies a new message based on these probability values — if the probability for spam is greater, then it classifies the message as spam. Otherwise, it classifies it as non-spam (if the two probability values are equal, then we may need a human to classify the message).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% — so we expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the algorithm, we'll use a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans. The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the [The UCI Machine Learning Repository.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). The data collection process is described in more details on [this page](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/#composition), where you can also find some of the papers authored by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo.\n",
