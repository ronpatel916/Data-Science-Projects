In this project, I apply a variety of machine learning models to predict communal bikeshare ridership in Washington D.C.

I apply Feature Engineering and Feature Selection to make and select the proper features to use in my model. Additionally, ensemble models such as random forests were applied to combine a variety of machine learning models to create a more accurate final prediction.
