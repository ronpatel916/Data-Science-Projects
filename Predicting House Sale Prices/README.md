In this project, I apply a Linear Regression Machine Learning model to predict house sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset.

I apply **Feature Engineering** and **Feature Selection** to make and select the proper features to use in my model.
When training and testing my model, holdout, simple, and cross validations were used applied, as well as hyperparameter optimization.
